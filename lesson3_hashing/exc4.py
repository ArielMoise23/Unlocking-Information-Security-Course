"""
The function weak_md5 is a "weaker" version of MD5, using only the first 5 bytes of the MD5 hash. This means its hashing size is  ùëõ=40  
and it can be brute forced rather easily.

Implement a function find_collisions that loops over all the possible strings until it finds an arbitrary collision - that is, 
two different strings whose hash is the same - and returns them (as a tuple).
